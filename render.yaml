# If you also want to deploy the Vite frontend on Render (optional), you could add
# another service of type "static" pointing at the same rootDir and publish the "dist" folder
# after running "npm run build". Example (commented out):
#  - type: web
#    name: leo-victory-web
#    env: static
#    rootDir: project
#    buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
#    staticPublishPath: dist
